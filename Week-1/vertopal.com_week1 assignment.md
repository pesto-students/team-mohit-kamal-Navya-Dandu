> **1. What is a protocol stack, and how is it used in web
> development?**

In web development, protocol stack refers to collection of networks to
establish a communication between components. Protocol stack mainly has
four layers.

-   Application layer -- which has http, tls and dns and used for
    security and encryption purposes and to display on the screen for
    the end user.

-   Transport layer- which has TCP and UDP and is responsible for
    sending and receiving data packets.

-   Network layer- which has IP(V4,v6) and is used for routing and
    forwarding data packets across different networks. It determines the
    best path for data to travel from the source device to the
    destination device in a computer network

-   Link layer - The link layer is responsible for the transmission of
    data over a physical network link, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi. It
    ensures that data is reliably transmitted between directly connected
    devices.

2.  **What are the different types of web servers, and how do they
    differ in terms of functionality and performance?**

> There are several types of web servers commonly used on the internet.
> Some of the different types include:
>
> Apache HTTP Server: Apache is one of the most widely used web servers.
> It is open-source and runs on various operating systems. Apache
> supports many features and modules, making it highly customizable.
>
> Nginx: Nginx (pronounced \"engine-x\") is a lightweight and
> high-performance web server. It is known for its efficiency in
> handling concurrent connections and serving static content. Nginx is
> often used as a reverse proxy server or load balancer.
>
> Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS): IIS is a web server
> developed by Microsoft for Windows operating systems. It integrates
> well with other Microsoft products and provides robust features for
> hosting ASP.NET applications.
>
> Node.js: Node.js is not a traditional web server but a runtime
> environment that allows JavaScript code to run on the server-side.
> With frameworks like Express

3.  **What is web hosting, and what are the different types of hosting
    services available for websites?**

> Web hosting is the process where a web hosting provider stores and
> maintains website files and applications on a server to make its
> customers\' websites accessible on the internet.
>
> The different types of web hosting are:

-   Shared hosting

-   Cloud hosting

-   Managed hosting

-   VPS hosting

-   Dedicated hosting

4.  **What is scaling, and why is it important for web applications? How
    does scaling differ for vertical and horizontal scaling?**

> The potential of your application to cope with increasing numbers of
> users simultaneously interacting with it. Ultimately, you want it to
> grow and be able to handle more and more requests per minute (RPMs).
>
> Vertical scaling-This involves increasing the resources of a single
> server or machine to handle more workload. Vertical scaling means
> adding more power to the existing server, such as increasing its
> memory, processing power, or storage capacity. This approach allows
> the server to handle a higher load by becoming more capable.
>
> Horizontal scaling-This involves adding more servers or machines to
> distribute the workload across multiple systems. With horizontal
> scaling, multiple servers work together to share the load and process
> requests. Each server handles a portion of the workload, allowing for
> better performance and higher capacity as more servers are added.

5.  **What is SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and how can web
    developers optimize their websites for better search engine
    rankings?**

> Search engine optimization (SEO) is the art and science of getting
> pages to rank higher in search engines such as Google. Because these
> are the main ways in which people discover content online, ranking
> higher in search engines can lead to an increase in traffic to a
> website.
>
> Web developers can optimise their website using few factors like
> content optimization, analysis, mobile-friendly design, page loading
> speed, user experience, regular updates and fresh content. It\'s
> important to monitor website analytics, conduct keyword research, and
> stay updated with the latest SEO practices to continually optimize
> your website for better search engine rankings.
